Hello there
my name is sandra atino and i am 31 years old originally from uganda but lived in belgium close to 6years now.
A am a graduate of radio and tv electronics although i have mainly worked in a graphic design field creating wedding cards and bussiness cards.
eversince moving to belgium (wallonia) i kind of lost my way due to language difficulty and recently i got struck by luck when a friend of mine send me a link about hack your future belgium.
This definitely grabbed my attention and so i took the challenge and the more assignements i did ..the more curious i got.
now i find myself with a more serious thirst to learn even more and better to be able to create projects.
