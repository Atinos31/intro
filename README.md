Hello there
my name is *Sandra Atino* and i am 31 years old , originally from **Uganda** but i have lived in belgium close to 6years now.
A am a graduate of radio and tv electronics although i have mainly worked in a **graphic design** field creating wedding cards and bussiness cards.
Eversince moving to Belgium **(wallonia)** i kind of lost my way due to language difficulty but recently i got struck by luck when a friend  send me a link about hack your future Belgium, this definitely grabbed my attention and so i took the challenge and the more assignements i did ..the more curious i got.
Now i find myself with a more serious thirst to learn even more and better to be able to create projects.
I  am ready to learn from my mistakes.
